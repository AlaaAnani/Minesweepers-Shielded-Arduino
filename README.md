# Minesweepers-Shielded-Arduino
This is the code used on the sheilded Arduino during the competition Minesweepers '18. The sketch uses UDP protocol for receiving and sending data to the control station (LabVIEW) like the received sensors data. It also receives commands from the station for certain tasks; Joystick control, reset signal, activating PID control for angle and PWM adjustment.
